//ultimate goal is to ramp up a light beginning at sunrise, climbing to 100% by noon then ramping down for the remainder of daylight


//use sun node to create variables for each sun event - these variables should be Eastern Standard Time, without dates



//create a variable and output a msg.dayLightMinutes for dayLightMinutes calculated by sunrise and sunset times
//create a variable and out for daylightMinutesRemaining

//delay between brightness steps
// delay = (dayLightMinutes / 2) / 100


//Ramp Up & Ramp Down
//create a variable called brightness_pct

//ramp up brightness percentage 
//dayLightMinutes - 


//ramp down birghtness percentage
